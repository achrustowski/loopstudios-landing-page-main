## My process

After writing all HTML, CSS custom properties and basic styling I started with desktop nav using flex and after that mobile nav. I wanted to try that workflow for the entire project so for each section I was first dealing with desktop view (in some cases setting only media query for min-width to avoid overwriting my code).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a bit about aria attributes and how to use those for mobile nav (thank to Kevin Powell's videos [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPHMqqyD2kY&t=28s&ab_channel=KevinPowell)).

I also learned how to ease the workflow a ton by constantly switching between desktop and mobile view and code those simultaneously (well, almost).

### Continued development

I will continue developing my understanding around aria attributes as well as getting more comfortable working with mobile view.

### Useful resources
